Hi, I am Opensource Knight!

Today, I will introduce:
  - How to remote running Apache Karaf Instance by using System native clients.
  - How to remote running Apache Karaf Instance by using Karaf Client.
  - Using org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg file.

1. Start an Apache Karaf Instance(as a server).
2. Open a Terminal program. For example, I use Guake Terminal.
3. Connect the server by using standard ssh command, Karaf has default username and password is karaf/karaf, and default port is 8101
for example, I connect to localhost via command: ssh -p 8101 karaf@localhost
4. Ok, the second way is using Karaf client, start client with following parameters:
  -a: port number(8101 by default)
  -h: host address
  -u: username
For example, I go to /bin folder and use this command: ./client -a 8191 -h localhost -u karaf
5. Karaf use /etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg file to store settings, for example, we can change 8101 port to another. Let me show:

Thank you for watching ^_^
