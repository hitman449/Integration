Hi, I am OpenSource Knight :-)

This video will introduce:
  1. How to start Apache Karaf.
     - Download.
     - Path to start.
  2. Create 'Hello World' examle with Apache Camel on Karaf:
     - The source is a timer.
     - The destination is stream out(will display in console).

The platform:
  - 1.7 is the version of Java to use in this video.
  - Apache Karaf 3.0.4(Require Java 1.?)

ok, let us start now :)

1. Check the version of current Java:
2. Go to http://karaf.apache.org to download Karaf: You can choose any versions, in this video I use Karaf 3.0.4
3. Extract and go to bin/ folder.
4. Apache Karaf supports different start mode(Regular, Server and Background). For example, enter "./karaf" to start Karaf in Regular mode now :)
5. After waiting, the console will look like this.
6. Before we can use Apache Camel, we have to install it by this commands: "feature:repo-add camel" and follow by "feature:install camel camel-stream"
7. Create a xml file with the following content, then copy it to deploy folder(one of the Karaf folders):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans
   xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
   <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring" autoStartup="true">
        <route id="example-route" autoStartup="true">
            <description>Example Camel Route</description>
            <from uri="timer:foo?period=1s" />
      			<transform>
      				<simple>Hello World ${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}</simple>
      			</transform>
            <to uri="stream:out"/>
        </route>
    </camelContext>
</beans>

8. Let us enjoy! ^_^

Thank for watching.
